# Store Page Copy – Quarantine of Joy

## One‑Line Hook
Steal back laughter in a city that outlawed fun—weaponize memes, roast tyrants, and repaint the world in color.

## Short Description
Quarantine of Joy is a story‑driven arcade shooter where your skill brings color back to a sterilized megacity. Build hype, remix punchlines, and topple the Bureau of Blandness—then decide the fate of a sentient Algorithm.

## Long Description
The Bureau of Blandness quarantined culture, scrubbed the feeds, and muted a generation. You’re the Courier—a rogue from the Memetic Underground—hijacking relays, recovering the lost Meme Archive, and broadcasting joy to the streets. As your Hype Meter rises, the city blooms with color, crowds rally to your side, and billboards flip to your signal. Roast the Commissioner live, crash the Brandfather’s spectacle, survive trendstorms, and face the Algorithm’s guardian: the Echo Hydraclone, a fractal replicator that splits into smaller clones across capped generations. In the Server Cathedral, choose: free the Algorithm to guard plurality—or reset it and give the power back to the people.

## Key Features
- Laughter Is Power: Raise hype to supercharge movement, crits, and crowd buffs
- Remix Punchlines: Craft ultimates that reshape encounters
- Dynamic Trendstorms: Opt‑in modifiers create highlight moments
- Living City: Re‑saturate districts; crowds chant, heal, and block enemy spawns
- Bosses With Bite: Roast Commissioner Sanitizer, unmask the Brandfather, and outsmart the Echo Hydraclone
- Finale With Choice: Free or reset The Algorithm; both endings set up post‑game play

## What Sets It Apart
- Story and combat feed each other—your performance paints the world
