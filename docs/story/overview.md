# Narrative Overview

## Elevator Pitch
In a sterilized megacity where the Bureau of Blandness outlawed memes and drained the world of laughter, a rogue courier from the Memetic Underground fights to steal back the Archive and broadcast joy to a culture under quarantine.

## Setting
- Time/Place: Near‑future Echo City, a neon sprawl under perpetual "Content Quarantine"—feeds filtered, jokes flagged, color desaturated.
- Visual Identity: Neon‑glitch meets municipal minimalism. Saturation literally returns as the player spreads memes.
- Tech Level: Ubiquitous AR, corporate cloud cathedrals, autonomous moderation drones, and black‑box recommendation engines.

## Themes and Tone
- Themes: Freedom of expression vs control, community over consumption, the sacred absurd.
- Tone and Mood: Irreverent, hopeful, satirical; stakes are real but the style is playful.
- Player Fantasy: Guerrilla culture‑hero who weaponizes humor and remix to dismantle a sterile regime.

## Narrative Pillars
- Laughter Is Power: Memes are literal energy—fueling abilities, lighting the world, beating back the grey.
- Remix and Reclaim: Scavenge memefragments, remix them into powerful punchlines and buffs.
- Roast the Tyrant: Satire cuts through fear; bosses are vulnerable to ridicule mechanics and exposure of hypocrisy.

## Spoiler‑Free Synopsis
The Courier hunts fragments of the Great Meme Archive, topples censorship towers, and outwits the city’s sentient Algorithm—all to craft and broadcast the Omega Meme: a cultural reboot that breaks the quarantine and restores communal joy.

## Integration With Gameplay
- Core loop alignment: Fight waves of BoB forces (shooters, flyers, bosses), loot memefragments, build the Hype Meter combo, unleash punchline abilities.
- Progression beats: Early: recover basics and small laughs. Mid: hijack signals, turn drones. Late: take the fight to the Server Cathedral, free the Algorithm.
- Systemic narrative: World saturation, billboard content, and crowd emotes react to your combo and mission outcomes.
- Boss roster highlight: Commissioner Sanitizer, Influencer Militia Captain (with Ad Zeppelin), Broodmaker, Algorithm Shard Avatar, and Echo Hydraclone. New crackdown force: Strike Adjudicator of the Content Court.

## Open Questions
- How many memefragment sets to craft the Omega Meme without pacing drag?
- Which late‑game twist best serves player agency: destroy vs redeem the Algorithm?
