## Overview

**High concept**: A fast, satirical memetic FPS for the browser. Play as the Courier sprinting through Echo City to steal memefragments and beam them to the crowd while Bureau of Blandness censors and corporate influencers hunt you. Color and music flow back into the streets as your combo climbs.

**Pillars**
- **Laughter Is Power**: Meme energy fuels abilities and literally re-saturates the world.
- **Always Moving**: Momentum-focused movement—sprint, slide, and dash to stay ahead of BoB patrols.
- **Remix the City**: Collected fragments unlock punchlines that remix weapons, billboards, and enemy behaviors.
- **Roast the Tyrant**: Bosses and drones crack under targeted ridicule and exposed hypocrisy.

**Genre**: Single-player arcade FPS / action roguelite.

**Platform**: Desktop web (modern browsers). Controls target keyboard + mouse.

**Session length**: 3–10 minute runs through quarantined zones.
