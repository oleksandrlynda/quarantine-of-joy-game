# Weapon Tier List

_Last update: 2025-08-22_

This list ranks primaries and sidearms by overall effectiveness across waves (DPS, effective range, control, ammo economy, utility). It assumes default enemy HP and current weapon configs.

---

## S Tier — Best-in-slot / meta

### DMR
- Long range, pinpoint accuracy, huge crits.
- Limited penetration on second target; strong knockback.
- Downsides: slower ROF, smaller mag; positioning matters.

### Rifle
- Rock-solid mid-range DPS with controllable spray pattern.
- Forgiving recoil; versatile in most arenas.
- Downsides: falls off at long range vs elites.

---

## A Tier — Powerful but more situational

### Shotgun
- Deletes packs at close range; pellet burst scales with proximity.
- Downsides: steep falloff past ~short range; requires spacing and cover.

### SMG
- High DPS at close–mid range, fast handling.
- Downsides: noticeable damage falloff beyond ~mid range.

### BeamSaber
- Infinite “ammo”, charge attack for burst; crowd control via knockback.
- Downsides: melee risk window; reduced reach vs ranged threats.

---

## B Tier — Strong in narrow roles

### Grenade Pistol
- AoE burst for packs and heavies; scales with placement.
- Downsides: low ammo; ballistic arc (skill/space dependent).

### Minigun
- Horde shredder; constant stagger on trash mobs.
- Downsides: low per-bullet damage, heavy ammo consumption; weak on singles at range.

---

## C Tier — Backup / starter

### Pistol
- Reliable starter; headshots still serviceable early.
- Downsides: poor sustained DPS; quickly outclassed.

## Recommended Loadouts

- **Rifle + Grenade** — All-rounder lane control + AoE nuke when swarmed.
- **DMR + SMG** — Elite deletion at range + close-quarters cleanup.
- **Shotgun + BeamSaber** — Aggressive brawl setup for tight maps.
- **Rifle + BeamSaber** — Safe mid-range with a panic button for rushers.

## Notes & Philosophy

- Tiers reflect *average* value across waves and map styles; your map and playstyle can shift rankings.
- Ammo economy and time-to-kill under movement/recoil are weighted more than raw per-shot damage.
- If a weapon receives significant stat changes (damage, spread, range, mag/reserve, or unique mechanics), revisit its tier and loadout synergies.
